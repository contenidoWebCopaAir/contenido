	<p class="date-field">Panama City, Panama, June 21, 2016</p>
	<p>Copa Airlines {NYSE: CPA}, a subsidiary of Copa Holdings, S.A., and member of the Star Alliance global airline network, today began operations to Holguin, Cuba. The two-times-weekly flights connect the eastern side of the island to Copa’s extensive network of 74 destinations in 31 countries in North, Central and South America and the Caribbean through its Hub of the Americas in Panama City.</p>

	<p>“Copa Airlines is pleased to begin operations to Holguin, our third destination on the island of Cuba,” said Copa Airlines CEO Pedro Heilbron. “We now offer service to 15 destinations in the Caribbean, reflecting Copa’s leadership in the region and adding to our connectivity through the Hub of the Americas in Panama City.  We are committed to connecting Cuba with the rest of America and to enhancing its role as a tourism and cultural center in the region.”</p>

	<p>Copa will operate two-times-weekly flights on Tuesdays and Saturdays. Flight CM 400 will depart Tocumen International Airport in Panama at 9:01 a.m., arriving at Frank País International Airport in Holguin at 12:31 p.m. The return flight, CM 401, will depart Holguín at 1:21 p.m., arriving in Panama at 2:47 p.m. Approximate flying time is 2 hours and 30 minutes.</p>

	<p>Christopher Columbus called Holguin "the most beautiful land that man has ever seen" in 1492. Holguin’s tourist attractions make it the No. 3 destination on the island, including more than 40 beaches with crystal-clear water, a rich marine life and extensive forests. Holguin’s major natural attractions include Guayabo Falls, Cayo Bariay, Marina Vita and Cayo Saetía.</p>

	<p>Holguin’s important cultural and historical sites include the "Cuchillas del Toa" biosphere reserve, Alexander Von Humboldt national park (a UNESCO World Heritage Site), the cacao trail in the Finca Duaba farm, Carlos Manuel de Cespedes Park and the Antonio Maceo Plaza.</p>

	<p>“The opening of this new destination is only one of the many events that continue to demonstrate the economic strength and stability of our country — factors that have made us become a highly competitive nation.  I congratulate Copa Airlines on this initiative, which will result in the growth of tourism and trade for Cuba, as well as for Panama”, said Augusto Arosemena, Minister of Commerce and Industry of Panama.</p>

	<p>Guests attending an inaugural flight ceremony at Tocumen International Airport in Panama included Augusto Arosemena, Minister of Trade and Industries; Francisco Escobar, Ambassador of Panama in Cuba; Antonio Miguel Pardo, Ambassador of Cuba in Panama; Joseph Fidanque III, General Manager of Tocumen International Airport; and airline executives and staff.</p> 

	<p>Copa Airlines will operate a modern Embraer 190 aircraft to Holguin with seating for 94 passengers: 10 in business class and 84 in the main cabin. The aircraft is configured with two seats on each side of the aisle, increasing passenger comfort.</p>

	<p>Copa Airlines operates nonstop flights from its Hub of the Americas in Panama City to more international destinations than any other airline from any other hub in North, Central and South America, and the Caribbean. The Holguin flight is timed for convenient connections to major markets such as Buenos Aires and Cordoba, Argentina; Quito and Guayaquil, Ecuador; Santiago, Chile; Santo Domingo, Dominican Republic; Sao Paulo, Brazil; Mexico City and Cancun, Mexico; Santa Cruz de la Sierra, Bolivia, and Lima, Peru. In-transit passengers making connections do not have to go through immigration and customs in Panama and baggage is checked to the passenger’s final destination.</p>

	<p>Currently Copa Airlines operates an average of 315 daily flights through its Hub of the Americas at Tocumen International Airport -- the hub with the most international flights in Latin America. Copa’s on-time performance of 91.69% has earned it OAG recognition as the “most on-time airline in Latin America” and No. 2 among airlines worldwide.</p>

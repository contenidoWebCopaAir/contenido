	<p>Copa Airlines {NYSE: CPA}, a subsidiary of Copa Holdings, S. A, and member of the Star Alliance global airline network, has been recognized by CFM International as “the airline with the best index of in-flight engine reliability”, earning Copa a place as one of the most reliable airlines in America and throughout the world in engineering, maintenance and flight operations.</p>
	
	<p>This is the first time CFM has bestowed the honor on an airline in the region. Not only does the honor demonstrate Copa Airlines’ reliability, it also is a reflection of the hard work and dedication of the airline’s more than 2,000 employees who are committed to the safety and well-being of passengers and crew, say airline officials.</p>
	
	<p>“We are proud to stand out as one of the most reliable airlines on the American continent in engine maintenance and performance,” said Ahmad Zamany, Vice President of Technical Operations, Copa Airlines.  “This important achievement is a motivation to us to continue growing, training our personnel and improving our maintenance operations logistics.”</p>

	<p>Copa Airline’s employees are a major reason for the achievement, Zamany said. “Their goal is meeting passengers’ need and to do so, they stay focused on raising and improving our standards of quality, enhancing our world-class service and creating the conditions for us to continue being the airline with the best on-time performance in Latin America and one of the best in the world,” he added.</p>

	<p>FlightStats has recognized Copa Airlines as the “Most on-time airline in Latin America for three consecutive years,” while OAG has named Copa the No. 2 airline for on-time performance in the world. Copa recently earned World Airline Awards from Skytrax for Best Airline in Central America / Caribbean, and for Best Airline Staff Service in Central America.  The new honor conferred by CFM adds to Copa’s list of differentiating factors among airlines in the region: world-class service, on-time performance and now, reliability. </p>

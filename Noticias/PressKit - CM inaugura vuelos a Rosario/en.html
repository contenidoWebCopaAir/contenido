	<p>Copa Airlines {NYSE: CPA}, a subsidiary of Copa Holdings, S.A. and member of the Star Alliance global airline network, today began direct nonstop flights from the Hub of the Americas at Tocumen International Airport in Panama City, Panama to Rosario, Argentina. The airline’s four-times-weekly flights will increase connectivity between one of the most important tourism, industrial and agricultural regions of the country and Copa’s extensive route network, consisting of 74 destinations in 31 countries in North, Central and South America and the Caribbean.</p>
	 
	<p>“Copa Airlines is proud to begin service to the city of Rosario, our third destination in Argentina, where we have operated for more than 16 years,” said Pedro Heilbron, CEO of Copa Airlines.  “From our Hub of the Americas in Panama we provide the best connectivity on the American continent and expect to contribute substantially to the development of tourism and business in this important Argentinean region.”</p>

	<p>Copa will operate flight CM 805 on Mondays, Wednesdays, Fridays and Sundays, departing at 3:22 p.m. from the airline’s Hub of the Americas at Tocumen International Airport in Panama, and arriving at the Islas Maldivas International Airport in Rosario, Argentina, at 12:09 a.m. the following day. The return flight, CM 806, will depart Mondays, Tuesdays, Thursdays and Saturdays at 1:20 a.m., arriving in Panama at 6:28 a.m.</p>
	 
	<p>“This important direct connection between Rosario and Copa Airlines’ extensive route network represents a new stage of aviation for our country,” said Guillermo Dietrich, Argentina’s Transportation Minister. “We want to give Argentineans more travel options and to make commercial air travel more national in scope, without having to go through Buenos Aires. This new route provides a gateway to the world that will bring opportunities for development to the region.”</p>

	
	<p>Argentina’s third-largest city in population, Rosario is located in Santa Fe Province and is considered the Cradle of the Argentine Flag. Its National Flag Memorial commemorates the raising of the “blue and white” for the first time on the shores of the Paraná River. Several well-known national figures grew up in Rosario: football (soccer) idol Lionel Messi, the Latin American political leader and revolutionary Ernesto Che Guevara, and painter Antonio Berni.</p>

	<p>Located in the east-central part of the country, Santa Fe Province is known for its tourist attractions including guided river tours on the Paraná River, lush vegetation, cuisine, art, architecture and culture, as well as a wide range of leisure activities in the city. Rosario also is an important economic, educational, financial, entertainment and agricultural center, forming part of the country’s “Agrarian Triangle” with Pergamino and Venado Tuerto.</p>

	<p>Rosario is passionate about soccer; in recognition of this passion, Copa Airlines will display the insignia of the city’s two most influential teams, C.A. Rosario Central and C.A. Newell’s Old Boys, as well as the phrase “Connected by a passion” on the Boeing 737-800 Premium aircraft operated for the inaugural flight. In addition, the aircraft will display the new city brand, “Rosario = Fútbol,” created by the studio of famed Argentine graphic designer Ronald Shakespear to promote harmony and respect.</p>
	 
	<p>Copa passengers can make convenient connections at the Hub of the Americas to the airline’s extensive route network, including Miami and Orlando in the U.S.; Havana and Santa Clara, Cuba; Cancun and Mexico City, Mexico; Punta Cana, Dominican Republic; Bogota and Cartagena, Colombia, and major cities of Central America and the Caribbean. </p> 

	<p>Currently Copa Airlines operates an average of 315 daily departures and arrivals through its Hub of the Americas at Tocumen International Airport, offering the most international flights of any airport in Latin America. In addition, Copa’s on-time performance of 91.69 percent recently earned the airline recognition as the “Most on-time airline in Latin America” and No. 2 in the world from London-based air travel intelligence company OAG.</p>

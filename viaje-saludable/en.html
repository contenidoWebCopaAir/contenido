<h3>Arterial thrombosis</h3>

<p>Arterial thrombosis is a condition involving the formation of blood clots in the legs. In susceptible individuals, prolonged periods of immobility (such as travel in a car, train, or airplane, or even sitting at your desk) can increase the risk of the formation of clots. If the clot breaks free and travels to the lungs or heart, it can be fatal.</p>

<p>There have been reports in the news about a relationship between Arterial Thrombosis and air travel. Currently, the Aerospace Medical Association advises that science has not established a direct, scientific link between Arterial Thrombosis and air travel. The World Health Organization plans to begin a study on the matter but currently advises that the risk of developing Arterial Thrombosis during travel is very small unless there are pre-existing risk factors. Some literature suggests that the exercises shown below, combined with some of the tips above, may decrease the risk of Arterial Thrombosis. If you have any concerns about arterial thrombosis, or your susceptibility to it, please consult your doctor.</p>

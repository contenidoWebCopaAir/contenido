<h2>Interline Agreements</h2>

<p>It is a commercial agreement between two Airlines in which one airline can sell the other's segments, and each airline will maintain its own code, allowing you to easily identify the operating airline.</p>

<p>These agreements enhance our network and offer you access to more destinations through our partner airlines.</p>

<p>It is important that you familiarize yourself with the operating airline’s conditions of carriage, which may sometimes differ from those of Copa Airlines. We recommend that you visit the operating airline’s website to review the conditions of carriage before you fly.</p>

<h2>Codeshare</h2>

<h3>What is a codeshare agreement?</h3>

<p>It is an agreement between two airlines in which one airline markets the other airline's flights using its own code in order to be able to offer more destination options.</p>

<h3>How to recognize a codeshare flight</h3>

<p>When you are selecting itineraries on copa.com, codeshare flights will be identified with a reference number next to the flight number. This number refers to a footnote indicating which airline will operate the flight.</p>

<p>This is an example of a codeshare flight:</p>

<p style="font-size:0.7em"><br />
<img alt="code share example" src="/documents/20182/2044195/tabla-completa-en.jpg/7a98a354-4678-4643-836b-3ad6afa2e78e?t=1482442471632" /><br />
<sup>1</sup> Flight is operated by United Airlines, Inc.</p>

<p>In this example, flight CM5628 has an indicator identifying United Airlines as the operating airline on the LAX-HNL route. Since it is a codeshare, the flight number begins with the letters ‘CM,’ which is Copa Airlines’ marketing code. You will also be able to identify the operating airline on your electronic itinerary.</p>

<h3>Itinerary changes</h3>

<p>If you want to make a change in your itinerary please call the <a href="/{{cultureFromUrl | lowercase}}/{{storeFrontFromUrl | lowercase}}/reservation-center" target="_blank">reservations center</a> or stop by one of Copa Airlines' <a href="/{{cultureFromUrl | lowercase}}/{{storeFrontFromUrl | lowercase}}/sales-offices" target="_blank">sales offices</a>.</p>

<p>Any involuntary itinerary changes and/or cancellations during the day of the flight (0-48 hours before the departure of the flight), are handled by the operating airline.</p>

<p>Any involuntary itinerary changes and/or cancellations before the day of the flight (more than 48 hours before departure) are handled by the airline.</p>

<p>The responsible airline, in any case, will be in charge of contacting the affected passengers and make timely changes in the reservation.</p>

<h3>Codeshare baggage policy</h3>

<p>We recommend checking the <a href="/{{cultureFromUrl | lowercase}}/{{storeFrontFromUrl | lowercase}}/interline-baggage-policy" target="_blank">interline baggage policy</a> before purchasing a codeshare flight as the rules vary according to the routes in your itinerary.</p>

<p>Copa Airlines currently has codeshare agreements with airlines in Asia, the Americas, and Europe.</p>

<h3>Frequently asked questions</h3>

<h4>1. Where can I find the Rental Terms and Conditions?</h4>

<p>Car rental terms and conditions can differ from country to country, car rental agent to car rental agent and vehicle to vehicle. Always consult the specific rental conditions relating to your rental quotation. On the quotation page of our booking process you can find the rental conditions by clicking the Rate Details link located to the right of the car type. You can also find them on the third and final step of the booking process under the Rental Conditions link at the bottom of the confirmation page. Finally, your rental Terms and Conditions can also be found on the confirmation voucher you need to bring to the rental desk.</p>

<h4>2. How can I pay for my booking?</h4>

<p>CarTrawler accepts Visa, Visa Delta, Visa Electron, Mastercard and Maestro/Laser for online payments. Please note at the time of pick up the local supplier will require a security deposit to be left for the vehicle. This takes the form of an amount (minimum: Excess + Fuel + VAT) being blocked on the primary drivers credit card. You must bring a credit card at the rental desk; Cash deposits, Maestro, Switch and debit cards such as Visa Electron are never accepted. The cards accepted by the suppliers are listed in the rental conditions under "rate details" on the results page.</p>

<h4>3. How can I add additional or extra drivers to my booking?</h4>

<p>Additional drivers can be added on arrival at the rental office; the additional driver fee is also payable at the counter. All additional drivers must be physically present at the rental counter at the time of rental with their own driver's licence to sign the rental agreement.</p>

<h4>4. What is CarTrawler's Cancellation Policy?</h4>

<p>Prepaid Rentals:&nbsp;If the booking is cancelled within 48 hours after the reservation is made, all funds will be reimbursed. If the booking is cancelled 48 hours after the reservation is made, a â‚¬20.00 flat fee will apply (approximately US $27). Note this applies for time of booking, not pick up time.</p>

<p>Post-paid Rentals (when the entire rental amount is due on arrival at the rental desk):&nbsp;There is no cancellation fee. In the event that you cancel or amend a credit/debit card booking CarTrawler will not be liable for any monetary losses suffered by you as a result of a change in monetary exchange rates between the time of your original booking and its subsequent cancellation or amendment (as applicable).</p>

<h4>5. What is a voucher and why do I need one?</h4>

<p>Your rental voucher is a document which will be emailed to you and must be printed and produced at the rental desk when you pick-up your vehicle. If you do not produce your voucher at the time of collection of the vehicle, the car rental supplier may apply a different rate than quoted or refuse to rent the vehicle. We cannot accept any appeal for a refund if you do not produce your voucher at the rental desk.</p>

<h4>6. What happens if I do not take my voucher with me?</h4>

<p>If you do not produce your voucher at the time of collection of the vehicle, the car rental supplier may apply a different rate than quoted or refuse to rent the vehicle. We cannot accept any appeal for a refund if you do not produce your voucher at the rental desk.</p>

<h4>7. What is a fuel policy?</h4>

<p>Your fuel policy is set by the car rental agent. Fuel policies include "pick-up full, return full" or "pick-up full, return empty". The fuel policy applying to your rental will be specified in your rental's Terms and Conditions, which can be found throughout the booking process.</p>

<h4>8. What are the age restrictions?</h4>

<p>Age restrictions are set by the car rental agent. Due to insurance restrictions, the car rental agent may have a minimum or maximum age of the driver they can rent to. You may find any age restriction applying to your rental in the Rental Terms and Conditions (or Rate Details). Some car rental agents also have a young or senior driver's fee for specific age groups.</p>

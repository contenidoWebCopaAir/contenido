<h2>Electronic Declaration of passengers’ goods (e-DBV-Brazil)</h2>

<p>Natural persons who enter or leave Brazil with funds in domestic or foreign currency, in an amount greater than R$10,000.00 (ten thousand reales), must present, at the customs checkpoint having jurisdiction over the respective point of entry into or exit from the country, the declaration of any valuables in the form of currency, checks, and traveler´s checks that they may be carrying.</p>

<p>The e-DBV replaces the old declaration on paper (the Declaration of Accompanied Baggage, or DBA), and the Electronic Declaration of Valuables Carried, or e-DPV, combining them into a single electronic declaration. The e-DBV offers convenience to travelers, who can complete their declaration even when they are still abroad, and pay any applicable import tax in advance, expediting their passage through Customs. Thus, travelers who enter or leave Brazil with valuables in the form of domestic or foreign currency, in an amount greater than R$10,000.00 (ten thousand reales) or the equivalent thereof in another currency, must present the <a href="https://www.edbv.receita.fazenda.gov.br/edbv-viajante/pages/selecionarAcao/selecionarAcao.jsf" id="electronicDeclarationPassangerGood" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Electronic Declaration of Passengers' Goods (e-DBV-Brazil)</a>.</p>

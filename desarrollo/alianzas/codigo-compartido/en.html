<h2>Codeshare</h2>

<h3>What is a codeshare agreement?</h3>

<p>A codeshare agreement is an agreement between two airlines that lets each airline market the other one’s flights using its own code, so that both airlines can offer more destination options.</p>

<h3>How to recognize a codeshare flight</h3>

<p>When you are viewing itineraries on copa.com, codeshare flights will be indicated by a reference number next to the flight number. This number refers to a footnote indicating which airline will operate the flight.</p>

<p>This is an example of a codeshare flight:</p>

<p><br />
<img alt="ejemplo de código compartido" src="/documents/20182/2044195/tabla-completa-en.jpg/7a98a354-4678-4643-836b-3ad6afa2e78e?t=1482442471632" /></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>In this example, flight CM5628 has an indicator identifying United Airlines as the operating airline on the LAX-HNL route. Since it is a codeshare, the flight number begins with the letters ‘CM,’ which is Copa Airlines’ marketing code. You will also be able to identify the operating airline on your electronic itinerary.</p>

<p>Copa Airlines currently has codeshare agreements with airlines in Asia, the Americas, and Europe.</p>

<p>When you book a codeshare flight, you will be notified in a timely manner which airline will operate the flight. The Conditions of Carriage may vary from one airline to another, so we recommend that you review the Conditions of Carriage on the operating airline’s website.</p>

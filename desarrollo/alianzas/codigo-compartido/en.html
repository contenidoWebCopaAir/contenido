<h2>Codeshare</h2>

<h3>What is a codeshare agreement?</h3>

<p>A codeshare agreement is an agreement between two airlines that lets each airline market the other one’s flights using its own code, so that both airlines can offer more destination options.</p>

<h3>How to recognize a codeshare flight</h3>

<p>When you are viewing itineraries on copa.com, codeshare flights will be indicated by a reference number next to the flight number. This number refers to a footnote indicating which airline will operate the flight.</p>

<p>This is an example of a codeshare flight:</p>

<p style="font-size:0.7em"><br />
<img alt="code share example" src="/documents/20182/2044195/tabla-completa-en.jpg/7a98a354-4678-4643-836b-3ad6afa2e78e?t=1482442471632" /><br />
<sup>1</sup> Flight is operated by United Airlines, Inc.</p>

<p>In this example, flight CM5628 has an indicator identifying United Airlines as the operating airline on the LAX-HNL route. Since it is a codeshare, the flight number begins with the letters ‘CM,’ which is Copa Airlines’ marketing code. You will also be able to identify the operating airline on your electronic itinerary.</p>

<h3>Itinerary changes</h3>
<p>The itinerary changes and / or cancellations during the day of the flight (0-48 hours before the departure of the flight), are handled by the operating airline.</p>
<p>Changes to the itinerary and / or cancellations before the day of the flight (49 hours or more before departure) are handled by the airline.</p>
<p>The responsible airline, in any case, will be in charge of contacting the affected passengers and make timely changes in the reservation.</p>

<h3>Codeshare baggage policy</h3>
<p>We recommend checking the <a href="/{{cultureFromUrl | lowercase}}/{{storeFrontFromUrl | lowercase}}/interline-baggage-policy" target="_blank">interline baggage policy</a> before purchasing a code-share flight as the rules vary according to the routes within your itinerary.</p>

<p>Copa Airlines currently has codeshare agreements with airlines in Asia, the Americas, and Europe.</p>

<p>When you book a codeshare flight, you will be notified in a timely manner which airline will operate the flight. The conditions of carriage may vary from one airline to another, so we recommend that you review the Conditions of Carriage on the operating airline’s website.</p>

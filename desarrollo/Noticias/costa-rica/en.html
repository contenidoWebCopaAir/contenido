	<p>Copa Airlines {NYSE: CPA} a subsidiary of Copa Holdings, S.A., and a member of the Star Alliance global airline network, is celebrating 50 years of continued service to Costa Rica, and has become Costa Rica’s first licensed “Country Brand” airline.</p>

	<p>Copa Airlines’ first international route, inaugurated in December 1966, connected Panama City, Panama with San Jose, Costa Rica, via three weekly flights.  Today, 50 years later, the airline operates the following flights from San Jose: 66 flights per week to/from Panama, 14 flights a week to/from Managua, 12 flights a week to/from Guatemala City, and seven flights a week to/from Tegucigalpa, Honduras. In addition, the airline operates two weekly flights connecting Liberia (Guanacaste Province), Costa Rica with Panama City.</p>

	<p>“We have become the airline with the greatest, long-term presence in Costa Rica, contributing significantly to the enhancement of the country’s opportunities for economic, business and tourism development and growth, and providing the best connectivity with the rest of the American continent,” said Copa CEO Pedro Heilbron.</p>

	<p>Copa Airlines celebrated its historic milestone in Costa Rica with a gala concert at the National Theater, attended by Costa Rican President Luis Guillermo Solís; Costa Rica’s Minister of Tourism Mauricio Ventura; Copa Airlines’ CEO Heilbron; Elisa Brenes, Copa’s Regional Manager for Central America and General Manager in Costa Rica, as well as Copa’s Costa Rican team. </p>

	<p>Copa Airlines has been a pioneer in raising aviation industry standards in Costa Rica and in providing Costa Rica with access to international connectivity through the Hub of the Americas in Panama, airline officials say. In addition, the airline has helped train aviation professionals and has introduced and positioned a consistent world-class passenger experience model in the market. </p>

	<p>The airline’s five decades of service led to the attainment of its Country Brand license, making Copa the first airline to be licensed as COSTA RICA essential, a national effort that promotes and supports the country’s international brand position for the purpose of stimulating tourism, exports and foreign investment in the country.</p>

	<p>“We are very proud of our 50 years of operation in the country and becoming part of the COSTA RICA essential effort, which not only recognizes our commitment to the values of excellence, social progress, sustainability, innovation and Costa Rican origins, but also motivates us to continue to strengthen our role in the growth of the country as we have done for half a century,” said Brenes, Copa’s Regional Manager for Central America and General Manager in Costa Rica.</p>

	<p>Copa Airlines has built strong ties with Costa Rica through the decades through its ongoing operations, generating employment opportunities and contributing to the aviation, business and tourism industries in Costa Rica. The airline will continue to offer the best connectivity on the continent through its Hub of the Americas in Panama, increasing Costa Ricans’ access to Latin American routes and providing world-class customer service, Brenes added.</p>
	
	<p>Copa Airlines currently operates an average of 315 daily departures and arrivals through its Hub of the Americas, which offers more international flights than any other airport in Latin America. Copa Airlines has an on-time performance rate of 91.69 percent; it recently was named the “Most On-time Airline in Latin America” and No. 2 worldwide by the London-based OAG.</p>

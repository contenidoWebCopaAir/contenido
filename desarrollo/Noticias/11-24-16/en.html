<p class="date-field">Panama, Nov. 24, 2016</p>

<p>Copa Airlines {NYSE: CPA}, a subsidiary of Copa Holdings, S.A., and a member of the Star Alliance global airline network, has launched a new on-board music channel “Panama Hits.” The channel showcases Panamanian musical talent, adding to the country’s international reputation as a tourist and cultural destination via music, with songs and videos from some of the country’s most iconic artists.</p>

<p>“As a multinational Panamanian company, Copa Airlines takes great pride in presenting this important project, which gives passengers traveling to and from our 70 destinations an introduction to the world-class Panamanian artists who have delighted us with their music for years,” said Marco Ocando, Senior Director of Marketing, Copa Airlines.</p>

<p>The channel, available from December on the airline’s 737-800 Premium aircraft with individual seatback entertainment screens, offers exclusive musical selections from outstanding national and international music industry talents such as Rubén Blades, Danilo Pérez, Los Gaitanes, Omar Alfanno and Erika Ender, among other renowned Panamanian singers and musicians. More than 35,000 passengers daily will be able to enjoy Panamanian rhythms, which airline officials hope will increase appreciation of the country’s culture.</p>

<p>“Panamanian artists believe it is important for global companies like Copa Airlines to support and promote our culture, which helps raise Panama’s artistic profile throughout the world,” said Panamanian singer-songwriter Rubén Blades, considered one of the top salsa musicians of all time.</p>

<p>Omar Alfanno, member of the Latin Songwriters Hall of Fame and celebrated as one of the greatest Latin American composers in history, said, “Copa Airlines’ wonderful initiative affords us the opportunity to show the world our music through the great Panamanian artists and composers. Thank you, Copa, for elevating our art to such great heights.”</p>

<p>Panama already has achieved worldwide recognition as a logistics, commercial and tourist hub; the Panama Hits channel adds to the country’s standing as a world-class cultural and musical hub, as well, Ocando said.</p>

<p>Initially, from the month of December, Panama Hits will consist of 14 music albums, nine music videos and two live concerts, becoming a unique platform for showcasing the country’s culture and talent. Panama Hits will be updated periodically to incorporate hits from additional Panamanian artists who exemplify the country’s cultural diversity and musical influence.</p>

<p>Copa Airlines is committed to the support of Panamanian art and culture, airline officials say, and will continue to explore ways to introduce non-Panamanians to Panama’s diverse artistic and cultural expression.</p>
